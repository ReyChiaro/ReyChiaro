# Hi 👋, I'm Rey Chill

I am a beginner in AI and currently study for my master degree in Computer Science.
During the past few months, I have made effort for designing computer vision algrithms and contrastive learning frameworks, unfortunately, these projects contribute nothing to current AI era as their mediocre performances. But these failed projects are valuable experiences in my future research. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Multimodal Models, Contrastive Learning and Computer Vision**

- 📝 I regularly write articles on [https://reychiaro.github.io](https://reychiaro.github.io)
